  <h2> Their Work </h2>
  <p> Prophets have many impressive partners like Orange, Crelan, Carrefour and Antwerp Province. At Prophets stragegists start out with a clear approach to ensure the creative proposal will match the business' needs.
    <br>UX-design is also an important part of their work. "Design is not about making stuff pretty . It's about making things work, in the most attractive way". They create a full user experience both online and offline. <br>
    Prophets also does all their production work in-house. They are up-to-date with the latest innovations. </p>
  <h2> My place at Prophets</h2>
  <p> Prophets caught my eye because I think I could learn a lot from their creative and innovative team. I would be amazing to have the opportunity to learn from a company that has so many incredible partnerships.
I believe I would be a great fit in the team because I am very eager to learn and have the right mindset. I can work independently, but I also enjoy working in a team. I share their passion for technology, therefore I am convinced we will have a great collaboration.
